# Modern JS: ES6 & Beyond

These playlists are here to show you some of the new syntax that's been added to Javascript since ES6 was released in 2015. The code here won't give you a whole lot of added functionality, but it will give you new ways to organize your code and new approaches to try out.

These lessons are recommended for when you start feeling comfortable with the basics, and want to try out some more advanced techniques.

All of this syntax is **very helpful** to know for React, so watch these videos and try using some of these tools in your own projects to get practice!
